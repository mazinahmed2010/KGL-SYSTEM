# 📖 Overview

The KGL-System is a full-stack inventory and sales management system, developed for Karibu Groceries Ltd, a wholesale distributor dealing in cereals and produce.

The company previously recorded all operations in\*manual black books, which caused:

- Data loss
- Calculation errors
- Slow reporting
- Lack of stock visibility across branches

This system digitizes the entire workflow, allowing managers and agents to manage inventory, procurement, and sales efficiently.

# 🏢 Business Context

Karibu Groceries Ltd operates two branches:

- Maganjo Branch
- \*Matugga Branch

The system enables:

✔ Real-time stock tracking
✔ Procurement recording
✔ Sales management
✔ Credit tracking for trusted buyers
✔ Executive reporting for directors
